# 2D-Incompressible-CFD-Simulator
This is a full-featured 2D incompressible flow simulator using the vorticity-streamfunction formulation, written in Python and Fortran. It supports a GUI-based parameter setup, flow around a circular obstacle, multiple solver choices, and full field visualizations. The simulation is powered by a Fortran backend and a Python frontend.
